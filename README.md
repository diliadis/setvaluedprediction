# Set-valued classification

Module for utility-based set-valued prediction in (hierarchical) multi-class classification. 

## Description

Package with implementation of utility-based set-valued prediction for flat and hierarchical multi-class classification. We provide predictors that supports both Scikit-learn and PyTorch.

## Installation
